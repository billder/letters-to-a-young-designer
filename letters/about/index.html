                <h1>About this site</h1>
<p>This project is essentially me trying to make sense of a corner of the world.</p>
<p>For example, I’m fascinated by these topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The effed-up state of the world, in a lot of different ways, and the need to right our ship before it’s too late</li>
<li>Futurism and coming technologies</li>
<li>The history of technology (evidenced by my prior delving into the history of the button)</li>
<li>Design as a profession</li>
<li>The process of aging and winding down of a career</li>
<li>The progression of generations through time</li>
<li>Building things</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all very different topics and each could be a book, but I don’t have time for that. This represents my ADHD brain constantly looking at too many things at once and drawing connections between them all. I needed to create a structure and format to help myself organically build up a bank of knowledge. Threading them all through the question of “what may the careers of today’s junior designers look like?“ lets me stitch together each of these pieces, while allowing for the process of inevitably bouncing around across focuses.</p>
<p>This material wants to be a book, but I’ve struggled to shape it into one that makes sense to me. The overall arc is clear to me, but the format of a book is by definition linear and fixed in time. I’m still exploring this material in a chaotic and fragmented way. Again, that’s the ADHD talking.</p>
<p>So good old-fashioned <a href="../hypertext/">hypertext</a> it is. Some have been calling this format a <a href="../digital-garden/">digital garden</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yes the title riffs on <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> from Rilke, which dangerously borderlines on pretentiousness.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="../booklist/">Several books</a> have inspired me along the way.</p>
