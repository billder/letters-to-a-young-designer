                <h1>Last third of my career</h1>
<p>This project began innocently enough with a simple question... What does the future look like for today’s young designers? What new challenges may they face? What types of jobs may become available? What new opportunities may arise that we can't conceive of yet? Which kinds of jobs will evolve or just won't exist anymore?</p>
<p>My asking these questions now is no accident, now that I am in the last third of my career. It's not sad, it's just math. Naturally, I'm reflecting more on the past than I used to. I mean, I'm not just sitting on the porch, plinking away on a banjo, but it's not hard to marvel at how different the world of design is now compared to when I started in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>It's the same reflection that today's young designers will experience in the 2050s. Take a 20 year-old starting out their life and career. Their year 2022 is the equivalent of my year 1985. My 2022 is their 2059. That number 2059 feels like science fiction, and yet it will very much be fact for today’s kids. Their reality will be different from my reality.</p>
