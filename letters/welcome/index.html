                <h1>Letters to a young designer</h1>
<p>Beginning your career in design or interested in learning what it’s all about? Welcome aboard to a flexible, impactful, evolving, rewarding, and often confusing way to make your way through life.</p>
<p>If I leave you with just three things, it’s this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your career, peaking in the 2050s, will have opportunities difficult for us to imagine today.</li>
<li>The world of design is much bigger than pixels that fit in rectangles.</li>
<li>Design can make people’s lives better. It can also make them much worse. Considering the state of the world, let's focus on better, or at least not worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>The questions we will ask herein are</p>
<ul>
<li>What future career possibilities may exist for today’s young designers?</li>
<li>How may the design field change? What can we learn from the past?</li>
<li>What new design career opportunities may arise?</li>
</ul>
<p>But naturally, these questions create bigger questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to design?</li>
<li>How will an increasingly challenging and complex world affect things?</li>
<li>How will new technologies contribute?</li>
<li>Ok, how really weird may things get?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
