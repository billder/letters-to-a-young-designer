                <h1>Technology changes reality</h1>
<p>New technologies introduced to the world can change our concept model of reality. They can change fundamental aspects of how we see the world, such as space, time, distance, scale, community, objects, and truth. At the simplest level, compare our understanding of the world in 2021 to that of 1821. Of course &quot;reality&quot; has evolved, but much of that can be attributed to the trains, planes, computers, televisions, networks, phones, and so on introduced along the way. It's a step by step process.</p>
<p>Not all technologies do this of course. A new type of USB plug doesn't shatter and reformulate or sense of reality (except maybe the mind bender of requiring three flips to find the right orientation), but when a new technology is truly impactful, it can forever change our concept model of reality.</p>
<p>To see this in action, we can look to the past to understand the present and the future. We can compare our sense of reality before a new technology existed against after it has permeated and settled into our world.</p>
