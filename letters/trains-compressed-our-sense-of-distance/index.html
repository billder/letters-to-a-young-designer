                <h1>Trains compressed our sense of distance</h1>
<p>For thousands of years into antiquity, our best option for traveling distances by land was by horse. And therefore, our fastest travel speed possible was the speed of a horse. Long-distance travel depended on the health of the horse, how much weight it was hauling, and so on. At best, we could travel about 25 miles per day.</p>
<p>This limitation of land speed (and expense) naturally dictated how far we traveled, which in turn dictated how big of a world we were aware of. We could only travel so many miles a day and only did so in extreme circumstances. Naturally, towns grew up about a horse day apart (is this true?). We rarely ventured far from our families and homes.</p>
<p>Our everyday sense of the world had a small radius. News from distant places took days or weeks to spread via chains of horse travel.</p>
<p>Then our world exploded almost 200 years ago with the introduction of locomotives in the 1820s.</p>
<p>Even though locomotives were invented in the 1820s, traveling by train didn’t become feasible for everyday people until the 1870s, when railroads for both passenger and freight purposes spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>In 1869, railroad networks in the eastern and western halves of the United States were finally connected (in Utah), leading to a boom of train travel. Travel from NY to SF went from months by stagecoach to a week by train, at about 20% of the cost.</p>
<p>Between 18xx and 18xx, xx000 miles of track grew like weeds across the United States. With the advent of passenger trains, we could travel further in a day, or for several days. Goods moved further. News came faster. We moved to new locations far more often.</p>
<p>Our everyday sense of the world expanded to a much larger radius.</p>
<p>For someone born in 1855, trains likely weren’t part of their daily awareness until they were around 15. (TRUE?) They knew the world when travel was by foot or horse, and then they experienced the transformation to a world when travel was by locomotive. By the time they were 40 in 1895, they could travel xxx miles in a day.</p>
<p>But for their child born in 1875, this was the way the world had always been.</p>
<p>Trains compressed our sense of distance. Fifty miles transformed from an adventure to an errand.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, our everyday sense of the world was small. After locomotives, our everyday sense of the world became big.</p>
<p>Trains compressed distance. Trains compressed time.</p>

<p>In an <a href="../https://books.google.com/books?id=sAdFAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=john+muir+transcontinental+railroad+annihilated&amp;dq=john+muir+transcontinental+railroad+annihilated&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh8fGSl6jkAhWwwFkKHTZJCuoQ6AEwAnoECAIQAg">1872 article</a>, naturalist John Muir wrote that the transcontinental railroad “annihilated” time and space. As Ronda explains, it changed the way that people viewed distances. “When you’re walking or riding a horse, you experience the world one way, but when you’re sitting in a railroad car, you see it differently,” he says. “In the West, where the distances are so great, the railroad brought near and far closer together.” The railroad schedules also helped to push the United States into changing how it marked time, leading to the <a href="../https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/railroads-create-the-first-time-zones">adoption of standard time zones in 1883</a>.**</p>
