                <h1>Augmented reality</h1>
<p>Interacting with digital creations will continue to expand beyond rectangles of pixels, adding digital layers on top of our physical reality (augmented) or creating entirely new realities (virtual).</p>
<p>Disposability</p>
<p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are blurring the lines between the physical reality surrounding us and the digital reality available via various technologies.<br>
Potential Outcome. You will be in the generation that not only creates the language to communicate what is “real” and what is “not real,” but also to have the conversation of whether this distinction is important at all.</p>
<p>Another one is mixed reality. Virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality. We will mash that up into one big bucket. In the case of augmented, you can replace your field of vision with virtual reality. Magic Leap has been under wraps for a few years, and they gave us a glimpse of what they have been working on. You are creating something in your room, stuff will be happy, knights will be tackling dragons, and it is not replacing reality, but it is an interesting first step of what can be created with those technologies.</p>
<p>This ability to manufacture more realistic things to the point where it’s hard to tell the difference between real real and manufactured real. That is where stuff starts getting more weird. How do we discern what is actually real? This will create a discipline called perception design. How do you perceive what is physical and digital? We were not even care anymore. There will be an awkward period in between the people want to know which is which.</p>
<p>Another thing related to augmented reality is… If this were to play… Now that we are overlaying instructions on top of manufacturing repair, I need to repair this engine. I do not know how to do this because I have not done it before. Augmenting that onto the physical thing itself, you can guide people through the process. I find that fascinating, because it is a really interesting use of augmented reality.</p>
<p>The ability to overlay guidance on top of physical stuff could lead to the question – how do you scale the whole process of very specific engine models that need to be repaired in several different ways, how do I scale that?</p>
<p>This could lead to an interesting resurgence of instructional design because it is a natural follow-through on that but in a new way. Then things could go strictly to hell.</p>
<p>This is a dystopian experiment done by Keiichi Matsuda a couple of years ago called Hyper-Reality, and it is a nightmare to look at. We are overwhelmed, but 20 years from now, is this normal? It is hard to say.</p>
<p>The question here becomes – there would be a temptation to flood the environment with this sort of thing. In a video, if this were reality, there wouldn’t be just one company producing all of this. There would be dozens of companies doing their individual thing in their individual spaces, there would be a temptation to flood the environment.</p>
<p>How do we modify the use of this in the real world? This could lead towards a branch of ethics design. Ethics will come up over and over, probably not a surprise there.</p>
