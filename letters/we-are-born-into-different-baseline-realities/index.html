                <h1>We are born into different baseline realities</h1>
<p>Each of us has what I’ll call a baseline reality.</p>
<p>We are all born into a situation, in a year, in a place, into a body, into some form of care. Different family types, some loving, some not. Different locations, some dense, some sparse, some hot, some cold. Different years, some before now, some after now.</p>
<p>But despite these differences, each of us as babies and toddlers figure out the world. We engage, interact, absorb, and explore our way into understanding this place we’ve arrived into. We expand from room to home to neighborhood to world.</p>
<p>Along the way we learn things that are available for us to learn.</p>
<p>Babies born in some decades learn that images can represent the world. Babies born in later decades learn that these images can move on a screen. Babies born in yet later decades learn that they can touch and manipulate these images to make other things happen. Babies in future decades may learn that they can touch and manipulate these images to create new physical objects that appear in front of them.</p>
<p>In every case, what we learn by say age five creates our sense of “normal”. This is our baseline of what the world is. Our baseline reality.</p>
<p>Everything that exists when we’re born will, as each of us individually grow up and learn of the world, always have existed. Color television, indoor plumbing, global communications, robotic surgery, fire, are part of “normal” when we know about them forever.</p>
<p>Some of us are 1954 babies, some 1972, 1999, 2013, or 2027. Each new year expands the set of “this has always existed.” For some of us, the web appeared as we were adults. For others of us, the web has just always been there like air and water. And so it goes.</p>
<p>And just like time, each of us is born into a different place, to different circumstances, which affects our experiences, perspectives, and opportunities in different ways from time does, but that’s a topic to be explored deeply in a different book. I can only handle one undefinable dimension at a time.</p>
<p>I am a 1965 baby, now 56yo in 2021. That timeframe gives me a particular lens different from other generations. Television has always been a part of life, but for my parents it became a big thing when they were teenagers. They experienced life both before and after television.</p>
<p>For anybody younger than 25, the web has always existed, central to how we live today. But for me, the web appeared when I was a working adult, fairly early in my career. I experienced life both before and after the web.</p>
<p>We have different baselines.</p>
<p>Yes we all change, but we all start from our individual baselines.</p>
<p>Today’s 5yo born in 2016 will have a very different sense of the world as a 55yo in the year 2065.</p>
