                <h1>Projecting future design challenges</h1>
<p>We now have all the elements necessary to begin projecting potential design challenges of the future. We’ve looked at how new techs can affect human behavior. We’ve looked at new techs coming on the horizon. Now we add them up to explore design challenges that may arrive during our careers.
Remember, we’re not talking about design jobs or design titles. Those are merely the formalized result of needing people to meet new types of challenges. We may invent job titles herein to use as a shorthand, but the important thing to explore is what you may be working on, not what you’re called while doing it.
