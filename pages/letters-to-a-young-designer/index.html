            <h1>Letters to a young designer</h1>
<p>Beginning your career in design or interested in learning what it’s all about? Welcome aboard to a flexible, impactful, evolving, rewarding, and confusing way to make your way through life.</p>
<p>This is a collection of essays for those of you starting your design career, written from the perspective of someone in the last third of his.</p>
<p>If I leave you with just three things, it’s this.</p>
<ul>
<li>The world of design is much bigger than making software.</li>
<li>Design can make people’s lives better. It can also make them much worse.</li>
<li>Your career, peaking in the 2050s, is going to be wild with opportunities hard for us to imagine today.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Essays that expand from a single question: <em>What future career possibilities may exist for today’s young designers?</em></p>
<p>The core principle here is that most discussions around &quot;Design&quot; today pigeonhole it as the process of producing screens to be developed, forcing it to be defined as a relationship between engineering and product management.</p>
<p>What's being lost is design as a means to address a problem.</p>
<p>But over the course of your career, the <em>range</em> of problems available</p>
<p>Fall in love with the problem, not the process. But there is a paradox here in that you will need to adapt to different types of problems and thus need a process to deep dive fast.</p>
<p>This collection will be hypertext because</p>
<ul>
<li>I struggled to shape it linearly into a book and this helps me publish faster.</li>
<li>It's a callback to the early web and even earlier to Ted Nelson's Xanadu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Core points.</p>
<ul>
<li>((Today’s young designers will be working in the 2050s)).</li>
<li>Ground yourself by <a href="../anchor-your-timeline/">anchoring your personal timeline in the future</a>.</li>
<li>“Design” is a complex and evolving word.</li>
<li><a href="../we-are-born-into-different-baseline-realities/">We are born into different baseline realities</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../technology-changes-reality/">Technology changes how we sense reality. Examples from the past and future.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The questions we will ask herein are</p>
<ul>
<li>What will the future hold for today's young designers?</li>
<li>How may the field change?</li>
<li>What new career opportunities may arise?</li>
</ul>
<p>But naturally, these questions create bigger questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to design?</li>
<li>How will an increasingly challenging world affect things?</li>
<li>How will new technologies contribute?</li>
<li>How will our sense of reality change?</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be perpetually evolving and unfinished. I'm aiming for depth over polish.</p>
