                <h1>Design is a verb</h1>
<p>Ok. I can’t avoid writing a book about the future of design without attempting to define the fuzzy word of design. Hundreds or thousands of people have attempted this. Here’s my take.</p>
<p>The problem is, “design” is a difficult word.</p>
<p>Design, the noun.</p>
<p>Design, the verb.</p>
<p>Design, the industry.</p>
<p>Design, the role.</p>
<p>“Design” is a fuzzy word.</p>
<p>Defining the damn thing</p>
<p>Bucky Fuller: comprehensive anticipatory designer</p>
<p>Design is one of the few words that means the activity and the outcome and the organization that delivers it.</p>
<p>Design is about the before and after. Having a common understanding of the before. Having an intentional target for the after. And where we are, right Now,</p>
<p>This book will intentionally avoid addressing the dreaded question of “what is design?” Too many pixels have been spilled over that and I personally don’t find it productive. However, what I do find more interesting than “design” the noun is “design” the verb.</p>
<p>Designing is bringing order to chaos.</p>
