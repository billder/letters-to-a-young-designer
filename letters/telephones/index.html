                <h1>Telephones</h1>
<p>Telephones expanded community.</p>
<p>Before the 1890s, we maintained personal communications across distances primarily via letters sent by horse or train. True, the telegraph had existed for a few decades, but people didnâ€™t commonly have telegraphs in their homes. They were reserved for more commercial or industrial purposes. For connecting with friends and family far away, we had to resort to ink on paper. What we knew of the daily lives of friends and family was necessarily days or weeks old, and vice versa. The back and forth of a conversation could take weeks.</p>
<p>Our everyday connections were delayed.</p>
<p>As phones became commonplace in homes from the 1890s to the 1920s, we could just pick up the phone and talk to someone right now, whether down the street or a long distance away.</p>
<p>Our everyday connections became immediate.</p>
