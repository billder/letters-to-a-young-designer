<p>Welcome to my book. Happy to have you here. Can I get you some water?<br>
This book is going to attempt a few things at the same time, hopefully smashed together into a logic that makes you think “huh.”<br>

<p>This book relies on a few key premises.<br>
Technologies newly introduced into everyday life affect how we understand and interact with the world. Obvious examples such as cars, the web, pocket phones, trains and more point to this.<br>
This pattern will continue into the future.<br>
Designers are often tasked with finding ways to blend new tech into everyday life.<br>
We can make reasonable guesses about the timing of coming technologies.<br>
We can know exactly how old we will be in future years based on our individual birth dates. Barring death of course.</p>
<p>Tech = technologies<br>
25yo = 25 year old</p>
