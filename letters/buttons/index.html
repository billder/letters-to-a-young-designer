                <h1>Buttons</h1>
<p>Buttons abstracted how we interact with the world.</p>
<p>Before 1898, we interacted with machines in mechanical ways. Push a crank, pull a handle, turn a wheel, putting muscle into the machine to make it do its thing. This was the world of physical levers, an era of our evolution that lasted a few thousand years, where any energy you physically exerted was amplified mechanically.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you could see this correlation between input and output. You could see the gears, the pulleys, the ropes to get a sense of what output would result from what input.</p>
<p>Our everyday sense of the world assumed a clear relationship between input and output, effort and result.</p>
<p>Electricity changed all this.</p>
<p>Some sadly unremembered person had the clever idea to make a small mechanism that opened or closed an electrical circuit to start or stop something. In the simplest case, turn a newly invented incandescent light bulb on or off.</p>
<p>Pushbuttons, eventually just called buttons, were introduced into daily life and in my opinion became the most significant invention of the 20th century, but that’s a topic for a different book.</p>
<p>The combination of buttons and electricity radically altered how we interact with objects. Doorbells, light switches, kitchen appliances, radios... all the way down to the phone I’m typing this sentence into.</p>
<p>Let’s notice what happened. Remember, before buttons, there was a direct correlation between effort and intent. Buttons shattered this. Now, the effort of a simple poke may ring a doorbell, light a light, start a blender, fire a missile. We had to focus attention on the buttons themselves because those singular relationships were lost. We no longer lived in a simply scalable world.</p>
<p>Buttons abstracted intent from effort.</p>
<p>Our everyday sense of the world ....</p>
